  <p>Large-scale distributed storage systems (DSS) are deployed widely in the world to empower data-intensive computing. The shift towards data-driven discoveries demands high-performance DSS that can manage massive datasets efficiently and reliably. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art DSS may experience correctness and/or performance issues due to the scale and complexity. We are building frameworks to improve data storage for robust data-driven discoveries at scale..</p>
