  <p>Large-scale distributed storage systems (DSS) are deployed widely in the world to empower data-intensive computing. The shift towards data-driven discoveries demands high-performance DSS that can manage massive datasets efficiently and reliably. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art DSS may experience correctness and/or performance issues due to the scale and complexity. We are building frameworks to improve data storage for robust data-driven discoveries at scale..</p>

  <p>Computational storage device combine original storage with computing chips together give both academic and industry a new chance to deploy their own work. Especially in Data Storage are, an new chance comming with offloading CPU tasks. We designed and deployed CSDGuard, an new framework for using CSD device for Erasure Coding and Ransomeware Detection purpose. The data compression feature also give much chance to do research.. </p>

  <p>We are investigating techniques to support emerging internet applications with demanding combinations of performance, reliability, and/or resilience requirements. Our current work focuses on scalable support for highly interactive applications (collaborative VR, immersive multiplayer gaming, remote manipulation).

This work uses structured overlay networks that run on top of the internet to implement custom routing and transport protocols to enable new services that are not well supported on the native internet. </p>
