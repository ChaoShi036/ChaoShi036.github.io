  <p>Large-scale distributed storage systems (DSS) are deployed widely in the world to empower data-intensive computing. The shift towards data-driven discoveries demands high-performance DSS that can manage massive datasets efficiently and reliably. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art DSS may experience correctness and/or performance issues due to the scale and complexity. We are building frameworks to improve data storage for robust data-driven discoveries at scale..</p>

  <p>Computational storage device combine original storage with computing chips together give both academic and industry a new chance to deploy their own work. Especially in Data Storage are, an new chance comming with offloading CPU tasks. We designed and deployed CSDGuard, an new framework for using CSD device for Erasure Coding and Ransomeware Detection purpose. The data compression feature also give much chance to do research.. </p>

  <p>We are investigating techniques to support emerging internet applications with demanding combinations of performance, reliability, and/or resilience requirements. Our current work focuses on scalable support for highly interactive applications (collaborative VR, immersive multiplayer gaming, remote manipulation).
This work uses structured overlay networks that run on top of the internet to implement custom routing and transport protocols to enable new services that are not well supported on the native internet. </p>

  <p>Multivariate time series forecasting plays an important role in various fields, such as meteorology, finance and medicine. Many practical problems in time series forecasting have multiple periods or dynamic periods. The complex dependencies between different time steps and time series contained in such datasets pose great challenges for prediction. To tackle the problems, we propose a Timescale Transformation (TT) module to progressively extract and integrate information from different timescales. Dependencies observed at different timescales in time series can be very different and complementary, which help to capture dependencies and trends more comprehensively. Besides, for time series with multiple periods or dynamic periods, the input contains many time steps not relevant for prediction and these redundant steps can even have negative effects. We thus propose a Salient Steps Detection (SSD) module to pay more attention to those relevant steps. Experimental results show that our model produces satisfying results over the state-of-the-art on two real-world multivariate time series datasets, with average 5.67% and 4.16% reduction on RSE metric separately. </p>

  <p>Block Chain introduced as an new technology, give its high impact to both industry and academic. With this topic becoming hot recent years, issues of chain process comes to real-world. Especially in data storage area, we observe the failure of system configurations from storage side may effect the chain process of whole block ecosystem, we are now expand our design of the configurations related issue in block ecosystem..  </p>
